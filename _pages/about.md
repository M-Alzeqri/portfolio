## About Me

I’m a passionate quant-in-the-making, blending mathematics and technology to drive data-driven solutions in finance. In my current role at the Canada Revenue Agency, I’ve led projects that automated more than 50% of manual workflows and increased operational efficiency by 40%. Through rigorous data analysis and risk modeling, I’ve helped identify high-compliance groups with 95% accuracy—up from 70%.

In parallel, I’ve applied mathematical principles as an AI Quantitative QA Engineer at Outlier, developing and executing sophisticated test procedures to ensure AI algorithms meet exacting standards. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, R, MATLAB, and Tableau. With hands-on experience in financial trading (FX, commodities, indices) and a deep understanding of risk, my goal is to transition into roles that push the boundaries of quantitative finance—whether in risk modeling, algorithmic trading, or research.
